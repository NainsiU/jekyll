![Client Server](../../pictures/client_server_architecture.png)

In client/server architecture, tasks are divided between clients and servers in a networked environment. It is widely used in applications such as web browsing, email, file sharing, and more.

**Client:**  
A client is a user's device or software application that initiates requests for services or resources from the server. It is responsible for presenting information to users, interacting with them, and sending requests to servers.

**Server:**  
A server provides services or resources to clients by handling incoming requests, processing data, performing computations, and managing resources. It stores and manages databases, files, and other resources that clients may need.

## Benefits

- **Resource Efficiency:**  
By distributing tasks between clients and servers, resource-intensive computations and data processing can be offloaded to powerful server systems. This frees up clients to focus on user interactions and presentation, resulting in optimized resource utilization.

- **Data Security and Integrity:**  
Servers can implement robust security measures, firewalls, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive data and ensure its integrity. This centralized approach helps maintain consistent security practices across the system.

- **Interoperability:**  
Different types of clients (desktop, mobile, web) can access the same services provided by the server, promoting cross-platform compatibility and enabling a wider user base to access the application.

- **Load Balancing:**  
Load balancers can be employed to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring even distribution of workloads and preventing any single server from being overwhelmed.

## Tangible Things to Do for Adoption

1. **Identify Server Functions:**  
   Determine the specific services or functions that will be provided by the server. This could be data storage, computation, authentication, or any other service that clients will rely on. Define the scope and responsibilities of the server components.

2. **Design Communication Protocols:**  
   Develop clear communication protocols between clients and the server. Decide how clients will make requests, how the server will process and respond to those requests, and how data will be transmitted between them. Choose appropriate networking technologies and standards.

3. **Select and Set Up Server Infrastructure:**  
   Choose the appropriate hardware and software for the server infrastructure. Set up servers that can handle the anticipated load and demand. Install necessary software components such as web servers, database systems, and security tools. Configure security measures, access controls, and backups to ensure the integrity and availability of data and services.
