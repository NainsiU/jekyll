![Layered Architecture](./../../pictures/Layerd.png)

Layered architecture, also known as the tiered architecture, is an architectural style that organizes a software system into distinct horizontal layers or tiers, each responsible for specific functions or services. The layers are usually arranged hierarchically, and each layer communicates with the adjacent layers. This approach promotes separation of concerns and modularity within the system.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a well-defined responsibility and a clear separation of concerns. This separation makes it easier to manage complex systems by isolating and addressing issues within specific layers without impacting others.
- **Scalability:** Layered architectures can be scaled horizontally, meaning you can add more instances of a particular layer or tier to handle increased load or demand. For example, you can add more web servers or application servers to accommodate a growing number of users in the presentation and business logic layers.
- **Interoperability:** Different layers can be developed using diverse technologies and programming languages as long as they communicate through well-defined interfaces (APIs). This flexibility enables the integration of legacy systems and the reuse of existing components, promoting interoperability.

## How to Adopt

### Identify and Define Layers

Clearly define the layers in your application, such as the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Make sure each layer has a well-defined responsibility.

### Separate Concerns

Ensure that each layer is responsible for a specific set of concerns. For example, separate user interface code from business logic and data access code.

### Define Interfaces

Clearly define the interfaces or APIs that will be used for communication between layers. This helps in creating a clear boundary between layers and enforces loose coupling.
