Low-code development is an approach to software development that uses visual interfaces and pre-built components to enable users to create applications with minimal manual coding. It's designed to make application development more accessible to non-developers.

## Benefits

- **Faster Application Development:** Low-code platforms enable the rapid creation of applications. Developers can build applications in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional coding.
- **Reduced Development Costs:** By automating and streamlining the development process, low-code platforms can significantly reduce development costs.
- **Empowerment of Citizen Developers:** Low-code platforms are designed to be user-friendly, allowing individuals with limited coding experience (citizen developers) to participate in application development.

## Tangible Things to Do for Adoption

1. **Assess Needs and Objectives:** Identify the specific business needs and objectives for adopting a low-code platform. Determine the types of applications or processes you intend to develop.
2. **Select a Low-Code Platform:** Choose a low-code platform that aligns with your project requirements, such as scalability, features, and integration capabilities. Evaluate different options and select the one that best fits your needs.
3. **User Training:** Provide training for your development team, citizen developers, and other stakeholders on how to use the selected low-code platform effectively. Ensure that everyone understands the platform's capabilities and features.
