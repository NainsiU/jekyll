In cybersecurity, a valet key is an access management concept that provides limited or temporary access to a system or data. It is often used to grant temporary and restricted permissions to users or services without giving them full access.

## Benefits

- **Security:**  
  Valet keys offer a higher level of security by restricting access to a specific, limited set of functions or data. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to critical or sensitive information.

- **Limited Privileges:**  
  Valet keys grant only the privileges needed for a specific task or purpose. Users or applications with valet keys can perform necessary actions without the risk of unintended or malicious activities.

- **Least Privilege Principle:**  
  Valet keys align with the principle of least privilege, which restricts users to the minimum access rights required to accomplish their tasks. This reduces the potential for misuse or abuse.

## Tangible Things to Do for Adoption

1. **Identify Use Cases:**  
   Identify specific use cases and scenarios where valet keys are needed. Determine which resources or functionalities require limited or temporary access.

2. **Access Control Policies:**  
   Develop access control policies that specify what actions users or applications with valet keys are allowed to perform and under what conditions.

3. **Access Duration:**  
   Determine the duration for which valet keys will be valid. You can set specific time limits or make them valid until a certain task is completed.
