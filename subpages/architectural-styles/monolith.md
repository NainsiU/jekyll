  <h1>Monolithic Architecture</h1>
  <img src="/pictures/Monolithic.png" alt="Monolithic Architecture">
  
  <p>A monolithic architecture is a traditional software design approach where an entire application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components and modules of the application are combined into a single codebase, and they share the same runtime environment and database.</p>

  <div class="benefits">
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplicity: Monolithic architectures are often simpler to develop and deploy, making them suitable for small to moderately complex applications.</li>
      <li>Ease of Testing: Testing is simpler because all components are closely integrated.</li>
      <li>Development Velocity: Developers can make changes across the application quickly since they are working within a single codebase.</li>
      <li>Lower Latency: Intra-application communication within the same runtime environment is often faster compared to inter-service communication in a microservices architecture.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="how-to-adopt">
    <h2>How to Adopt</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Setup and Design:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of your application.</li>
      <li>Architecture and Design: Plan the architecture of your application.</li>
      <li>Select Technology Stack: Choose the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are most suitable for your application's requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Development and Implementation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modular Design: Break down the application into logical modules or components.</li>
      <li>Coding Standards: Establish coding standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase.</li>
      <li>Database Design: Design the database schema for your application.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Testing and Deployment:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unit Testing: Write unit tests for each module or component to ensure that they function as expected.</li>
      <li>Integration Testing: Conduct integration testing to verify that different modules of the application work together seamlessly.</li>
    </ul>
